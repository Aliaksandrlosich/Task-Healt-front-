# Task-Healt-front-
npm run start

Adaptive, made with more, due to relative values, as it wasn't in the the specs. 
CORS on server is set up, just need to run back and listen to events.  
first planned to build the web, and get it from the back. But I'm not sure if that's what you needed to do. So I left the two applications running. 
Error handling (except input validation), as well as preloaders were not implemented, but variables were prepared. 
Didn't use Redux as it would have been redundant. In the current task, even the context was not useful.
